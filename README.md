# OBJ2GLTF

Convert OBJ models to glTF

## Getting Started

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't already have it, clone this repo, and then:
```
cd OBJ2GLTF
npm install
```
Run `node ./bin/obj2gltf.js` and pass it the path to an OBJ file.

## Limitations

This tool is still in development. We plan on adding additional features like gzip compression, binary glTF export, normal generation, and a testing suite.
